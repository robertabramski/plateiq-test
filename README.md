# Plate IQ Test

## Project Requirements

Implement the general layout of the screen.

The left side is a static image, use any placeholder there. On the right side you just need to implement the upper section which expands and collapses.

The remaining parts of the mock (the line items section, the history tab) are bonus. 

## Usage

`npm install` Install all required packages relevant to the project. Run this before any other command.

`ng start` Run the local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`.

`ng run build` Create a production payload into a `dist` directory.
